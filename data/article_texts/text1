Everything is a fight. Everything is a fight. Everything. Is. A. Fight...No one knows the feeling of love here, everybody’s been being mistreated for so long that it’s unheard of... every day just the thought of “Am I gonna make it back home tonight” that’s a crazy thought to deal with. Our emotions are just balled up inside of us, we angry. We angry. And not at anyone in particular, just coming out angry. [TITLE: I HAVE NO IDEA ON A TITLE] Nathaniel “Nate” Batty III / Member of the Black Guerilla Family: I’ve been like a sore thumb here. When I was younger, I was more like a nerd. I liked to read-Harry Potter was my favorite book. And I was picked on, when I was younger, because I stuck out, I was a little bit smarter than everyone else... so I found myself dumbing myself down, to fit in. Since I was 11 I’ve been getting locked up. I’m 25 now, every year since I was 11. Central booking... it’s the worst place I ever been. There’s been people that protested monday, that was arrested that still not let go! And it’s just a mess, dirty, filthy, a mess. Even though they criminals, we still people. And we don’t need to treat them like animals but they caged in like animals down there. [SOT from car ride to prison protest] Nate: Yeah I really am kinda nervous about going down there though. Mariah: Why? Nate: ‘Cause I don’t like seeing the building...I hate going down there. I’m in what you call the family. The Black Guerilla Family. And we’re an offspring of the Black Panthers. You got some people that perceive it as a gang, because they don’t understand...People fear things they don’t understand. So they first thing is to say alright they a gang they doing criminal activities. That’s just the outside look. My last current charge that I been in for was violation of probation, for a charge I caught in 2014, dealing with my children’s mother, second degree assault... I plead guilty to that. just to hurry up and get out of jail. [SOT from walk to prison: exchange between Nate and prisoners yelling about freddie gray solidarity] [SOT from presser at prison: “these cops will be trading their blue uniforms for orange ones..”] Undescribable. Undescribable. I just felt goosebumps everywhere. It just felt good to know that at least somebody’s been charged, at least somebody’s been held accountable. It was a great feeling. I think the whole city shared that feeling...goosebumps. It begins with bridging the gap. bridging the gap between the streets, and the regular citizens. [me: you don’t consider yourself a regular citizen?] Mmmm...and it’s crazy that I don’t...it’s crazy that I don’t...I don’t...I don’t know why I don’t. but I am a citizen here though. I am a citizen here. I am a citizen here. And I want to be treated like one. I definitely want to be treated like one. I always had the feeling that I was meant to be something great. I always wanted to go to school for political science, always... I always wanted to go to Morehouse. I used to say I was gonna be the first black President. And I don’t mean to seem like my ego is big, but it’s just something inside of me that roars... and finally for once, just being active in this I just feel whole, almost.... almost whole. I feel good about doing something. [nat sound from protest]
