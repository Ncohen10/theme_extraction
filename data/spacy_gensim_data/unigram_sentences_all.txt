in the two week since the incident Samuel Abrams a tenured professor of politic at Sarah Lawrence have repeatedly ask the college 's president Cristle Collins Judd to condemn the perpetrator action and reiterate -PRON- support for free speech
but after send a tepid campus wide email that mention the importance of free expression but mostly stress -PRON- commitment to diversity and inclusive excellence Judd speak with Abrams over the phone accord to -PRON- -PRON- accuse -PRON- of attack member of the community
-PRON- say -PRON- have create a hostile work environment Abrams say in an interview with Reason

if the op ed constitute hate speech then this be not a world that -PRON- want to be a part of
what be more when the two meet in person Judd imply that Abrams be on the market for a new job -PRON- say
-PRON- be not on the job market -PRON- say
-PRON- be tenure -PRON- live in New York
why would -PRON- go on the job market
Abrams interpret Judd 's remark as a suggestion that -PRON- may be well off leave the school
Judd do not respond to a request for comment
Abram 's op ed criticize the politically lopside event host by the college 's Office of Student Affairs include seminar on microaggression understand white privilege and stay wake

-PRON- also include original research a nationally representative survey of 900 administrator
accord to this data liberal administrator outnumber conservative 12 to 1
this would mean the rank of the administration be even more uniformly liberal than the faculty
while considerable focus have be place in recent decade on the impact of the ideological bent of college professor when -PRON- come to collegiate life live in dorm participate in extracurricular organization the ever grow rank of administrator have the big influence on student and campus life across the country write Abrams
many Sarah Lawrence student and alumnus do not appreciate Abrams call attention to this issue
there be an emergency student senate meeting to -PRON- knowledge say Abrams
-PRON- be -PRON- understanding that the meeting produce a declaration call for -PRON- to be strip of tenure and dismiss from the college
Judd send a campus wide email about the meeting which -PRON- describe as not only thoughtful but thought provoke
the Senate ask -PRON- to publicly affirm that Black live Matter that LBGT+ Lives matter and that Women 's Justice matter write Judd in the email
-PRON- emphatically do
the student senate do not immediately respond to a request for comment

Abrams believe the perpetrator try to break into -PRON- office some of -PRON- book have fall off -PRON- shelf as if the sign poster have slam the door and the wall
-PRON- be really shake -PRON- say
Abrams dealing with Judd have far unnerved -PRON-
during -PRON- conversation -PRON- imply that -PRON- should have clear -PRON- public writing with -PRON- before submit -PRON- something -PRON- describe as unacceptable
several of Abrams colleague meet with Judd to discuss the vandalism and express -PRON- view that such act could not be tolerate
Judd agree but do not pledge to take any further action
these professor think -PRON- seem scared that the student may hold more protest create a public relation disaster accord to Abrams
this incident be an example of a concern phenomenon college administrator go soft on free speech in an effort to appease a handful of extremely aggressive student
administrator should take great care to avoid explicit ideological bias and -PRON- must defend the free speech right of professor who speak out against -PRON-
a college that attempt to muzzle discourage or rid -PRON- of speech that offend the far leave be fail -PRON- mission
live in this world as a black man -PRON- ’ dangerous -PRON- say
because -PRON- be constantly live in a state of uncertainty
-PRON- want to be able to allow people to see -PRON- and see -PRON- as human being and hear -PRON- and hear -PRON- voice
and that be the work -PRON- want to do and that be the work -PRON- have be bless to do so far since move here to Chicago
